An application to track person absences. 
Presumably for a corporate use, can also be used by any type of team or collaboration groups.
plans: multiple users, sign in, utilize all planned out data in Sql, sending emails for notifying managers, subordinates etc., 
notifying user about upcoming holidays, _attempt_ to generate documents for absence submissions 
more plans: implement different databases and different UIs (WPF, web etc.)

MVP: single user with barebones data held
practical use - keep track of your days off balance
data stored in Sql
on onpening gets top 1 from person, if there is none - loads empty form, NewAbsence is unavailable, user will be saved on editing
